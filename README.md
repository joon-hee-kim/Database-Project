For simplicity, I have implemented class diagrams with class names only. </br>

1. Board.java: </br>
- Manages the main board interface where users can post messages, view posts, and interact with the posts by liking or deleting them. It integrates with the database to fetch and store posts. </br>

2. ChatServer.java: </br>
- Acts as a server for handling chat messages between users. Manages client connections and broadcasts messages to connected clients. </br> </br> 

3. ChatWindow.java: </br>
- Provides a chat interface for users to send and receive messages. Connects to ChatServer and interacts with DbAccess to store chat history. </br>
¬†

- Handles all database operations including user authentication, post management, follow management, and message storage.
- Acts as the data access layer for the application. </br>
